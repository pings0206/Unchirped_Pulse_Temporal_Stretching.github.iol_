        Pulse temporal modulation is a fundamental technique in modulating the laser pulse in time domain, playing a pivotal role in advancing various scientific disciplines, including ultrafast laser systems, spectroscopy, chirped pulse amplification, and terahertz laser technology. Its significance lies in its ability to enable precise control over pulse characteristics, facilitating critical advancements in these fields.

        However, a persistent challenge arises from the dispersion and nonlinear properties of materials, which often induce chirping in laser pulses during modulation. Traditional methods aimed at minimizing chirping are constrained by limitations, such as restricted time delay capabilities, stringent alignment requirements, and significant deformation of the pulse profile. These limitations highlight the need for innovative solutions that overcome these barriers while ensuring the fidelity and efficiency of pulse modulation.

        This study presents an in-depth exploration of unchirped laser pulse stretching, a fundamental technique in laser and optical sciences with significant applications in material processing, medical technologies, and advanced scientific research. The primary objective of this method is to temporally extend short, high-intensity laser pulses, thereby reducing their peak power and ensuring their safe and efficient use in various applications.

        The study firstly provides a comprehensive review of existing pulse stretching methods, including the use of gratings, prisms, optical fibers, and optical ring cavities. These techniques are analyzed for their strengths and limitations, particularly in mitigating chirping effects and maintaining pulse integrity. Building on this foundation, the paper introduces an innovative approach to unchirped pulse stretching based on the superposition of positively and negatively chirped pulses. This novel method effectively cancels chirping and achieves temporal stretching without introducing frequency variation.

        A practical implementation of the proposed technique is achieved through the multi-functionaity of flat photonics. The paper details the design of a two-metasurface system: the first metasurface splits an incoming chirped pulse into components with opposing chirping rates, while the second metasurface compensates for time delays and ensures precise temporal alignment. The metasurfaces are engineered to exhibit high transmission efficiency and tailored phase shifts, enabling effective control over pulse characteristics.

        The study rigorously evaluates the performance of the proposed method in terms of pulse duration, frequency sweep, and phase profiles. The results highlight the advantages of this approach, including its reduced sensitivity to alignment, minimal impact on output pulse profiles, and the ability to achieve significant pulse stretching. This work offers a robust and scalable solution for unchirped pulse stretching, paving the way for advancements in ultrafast laser systems and a broad range of photonics applications.
